### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sermsuk. I'm new around here. I just find my joy in competitive programming, but found out the difficulty to solve the problems due to lack of algorithms and data structures knowledge.

ðŸ’¬ As mentioned, I'll share my progress of how I learned and reviewed things to solve the problems mostly from codeforces and HackerRank.
